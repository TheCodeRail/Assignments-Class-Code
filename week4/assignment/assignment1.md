# Asynchronous JavaScript Assignment

This assignment contains a set of questions designed to help you practice and understand asynchronous JavaScript concepts, including `setTimeout`, Promises, and `async/await`.

### 1. Delayed Greeting
Write a function `delayedGreeting` that logs "Hello, World!" to the console after a delay of 2 seconds using `setTimeout`.

### 2 . Promises

Create a function fetchUserData that returns a Promise. This promise should resolve with a user object { name: "John Doe", age: 30 } after a delay of 3 seconds.

### 3 . Async/Await

Rewrite the fetchUserData function to use async/await syntax. Create a new function getUserData that calls fetchUserData and logs the user data to the console.

### 4. Fetch Api

`https://catfact.ninja/facts` use this api to get the data and then show only all the facts in the console
